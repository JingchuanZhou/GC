FinalProject Week 5

How to lauch the the current webpage.

I separate 2D and 3D parts into two web page.
Which is in 2d.html

For the 3D Model,in 3d.html this week target is:

Viewing: view your created object from multiple views by the three.js

I accomplished it by set a group of carmer position bottom. 
Front View, Upper View and Left View.

And, I also add more carmera button of isometric view, demitric view,trimetric view, one point view, two point view and three point view.

Draging the mouse can also find the view you need.

Light funtion are also done for this week. You can drag the lable on the right top to change the position of the light.

I have also finish the funtion of the new texture maping. Now the cube is an Mycraft grass cube. An the light and rotate function is done.
