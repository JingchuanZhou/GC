How to lauch the the current webpage.

In this week, I separate 2D and 3D parts into two web page.
I compelish the first 2D Model rotation part wiich didn't i didn't show in last week.And lose credit in first week

Which is in 2d.html

For the 3D Model,in 3d.html this week target is:

Viewing: view your created object from multiple views by the three.js

So i accomplish it by set a group of carmer position bottom. 
Front View, Upper View and Left View.

Also, other views can be view by draging the mouse to find.

I have set up the light part for the next week, but the function is not completed yet.
